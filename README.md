# Prose Mirror Solid Node Views

There's some example code in this repo on how to use [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/) 
Node views with [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/).
I was eventually going to turn this into a ProseMirror framework for Solid and I still might
but I haven't had the time to flesh it out yet at the moment.
I'm opening up this repo in case anyone wants to see this example implementation.
